# 🧠 Mental Health Analysis in the Tech Workplace

## 🌟 Overview
This project focuses on predicting attitudes towards mental health and assessing the likelihood of individuals seeking therapy based on various workplace and personal factors. It utilizes machine learning models to analyze responses from the **"Mental Health in Tech"** survey and offers insights into the prevalence and perception of mental health disorders within the tech industry.

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Predicts Attitudes Towards Mental Health:** Determines whether an individual is likely or unlikely to seek therapy based on provided survey responses.  
🤖 **Natural Language Explanations:** Integrates a local **LLaMA** model to provide detailed explanations for predictions.  
💡 **Coping Mechanisms & Next Steps:** Suggests personalized strategies for mental well-being.  
📞 **Government & Professional Resources:** Offers mental health helplines and professional support options.  
🌐 **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with **Streamlit** for easy interaction and result interpretation.  
📄 **PDF Report Generation:** Allows users to download a detailed analysis of their mental health prediction.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
🔹 **Machine Learning:** XGBoost model for prediction  
🔹 **NLP Integration:** LLaMA model using `ctransformers` for generating responses  
🔹 **Web Framework:** Streamlit  
🔹 **Data Processing:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn  
🔹 **PDF Generation:** `fpdf` library  

## 🔍 How It Works
1️⃣ **User Input:** The application collects responses related to workplace mental health policies, personal history, and attitudes.  
2️⃣ **Prediction Model:** The trained **XGBoost** model predicts whether the user is likely to seek therapy.  
3️⃣ **LLaMA-Based Explanation:** The local **LLaMA** model generates a detailed explanation for the prediction, including potential coping mechanisms and next steps.  
4️⃣ **PDF Report:** Users can download a structured report summarizing their assessment.
